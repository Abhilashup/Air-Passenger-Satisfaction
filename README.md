# Air-Passenger-Satisfaction

This is a model that predicts the satisfaction of passengers travelling in flights from a survey that was conducted in the US. The data was gathered from Kaggle. More than the creating the model, the main area of focus is to determine what are the features that drive customer satisfaction.


We can see in the dataset that there are passengers who are have travelled in three classes; the Eco Class,Eco Plus and the Business Class. As per their travel experience, they have rated their experience, they have rated their journey on the scale of 0-5 for various categories like Inflight Entertainment, Ease of Online Booking, On-Board Service, Checkin Service, Convenience of Departure and Arrival timings and more. The main column that we look out for in this is the satisfaction which has two types; one for the passengers who are satisfied and the other for those who are dissatisfied or are neutral about their flight journey experience. I have used both Classification Models as well as well as an Artificial Neural Network Model to make predictions.
